# Robust_RL_for_Algorithmic_Trading_ECE542
Finally, we aim to develop an efficient and robust DQN to ensure reliable algorithmic trading. Additionally, we must establish high-probability guarantees under adversarial poisoning. In other words, we seek to demonstrate that near-optimal performance can be achieved. Preliminary research on finite-time rates of model-free robust reinforcement learning without neural approximations has been conducted by a collaborator. The results, complete with mathematical guarantees and fundamental limits, have been published at **CDC 2024** and **AISTATS 2025**.
